//        In Java,two or more methods may have the same name if they differ in parameter
//        different no of parameters,different types of parameters or both
//        These methods are called overloaded methods and this feature is called method overloading
//
//        A method is on an object or is static in class.
//        A function is independent of any object (and outside of any class).
//
//        For Java and C#, there are only methods.
//        For C, there are only functions.
//
//         For C++ and Python it would depend on whether or not you're in a class.
//        But in basic English:
//
//        Function: Standalone feature or functionality.
//        Method: One way of doing something, which has different approaches or methods, but related to the same aspect (aka class).

//        method' is the object-oriented word for 'function'. That's pretty much all there is to it (ie., no real difference).
//        Unfortunately, I think a lot of the answers here are perpetuating or advancing the idea that there's some complex, meaningful difference.
//        Really - there isn't all that much to it, just different words for the same thing.

        //Method overloading is not associated with return types

=> Abstract classes and methods

- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated
- Instantiated means that we cannot create objects of abstract classes
- The way we can do it using the abstract keyword
- Classes as well as methods can also be abstract
- An Abstract class can have abstract methods as well as normal methods
- Abstract methods are created by using abstract keyword while declaring
- Abstract functions don't have a body/implementation.
- A normal class cannot have abstract methods if we want abstract methods than we need an abstract class
- Abstract classes can have subclasses i.e we can apply inheritance
  - A class containing abstract method should be abstract
- To implement features of abstract classes we inherit subclasses from it and create objects of the subclasses
- A subclass must override all the abstract methods of an abstract class
- We can access the static attributes and methods of an abstract class using the reference of abstract class

=> Abstraction: It is a concept of OOPs that basically allows us to hide unnecessary details and only show the needed information

- The major reason for introducing abstract method and classes is to take care of the second pillar of OOPs is abstraction
- The major use of abstract methods and classes is to achieve abstraction in java

# Stacks :

Stack is a data structure that follows LIFO(Last In First Out) Architecture.
meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. 
This behavior can be likened to a stack of plates, where you can only add or remove the top plate.
Stacks are widely used in various applications, including function call management in programming languages, 
undo mechanisms in text editors, and backtracking algorithms.


- Basic Operations of Stack

The primary operations that can be performed on a stack include:

1. Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. Pop: Removes the top element from the stack.
3. Peek: Retrieves the top element without removing it.
4. isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
5. isFull: Checks if the stack is full (in fixed-size implementations).

# Graph

A graph is a collection of nodes/vertices where each node might point to other nodes.The nodes represent real life entities and are connected by edges representing relationship between the entities/node.

## Applications of Graph

- Protein-protein interaction graphs
- Google maps
- Computer science
  - Network flow
  - Shortest path
  - Minimum spanning trees
- Electrical Engg
  - Circuit organization
- Networking
  - Routing algorithms
  - Vertex coloring for frequency assignment
- Biology
  - Protein-protein interaction
  - Metabolic networks

## Types of Graphs

Based on the nature of edge we can define different types of graphs

1. Undirected graph
2. Directed Graph
3. Weighted Graph

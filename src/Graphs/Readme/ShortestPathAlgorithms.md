# Shortest Path Algorithms

Shortest path algorithms are techniques used to find the shortest path or minimum distance between two vertices in a graph. They are widely used in navigation, network design, and optimization problems.


### **Types of Shortest Path Problems**

1. **Single-Source Shortest Path**:
   * Find the shortest paths from a given source vertex to all other vertices.
   * Examples: Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
2. **Single-Pair Shortest Path**:
   * Find the shortest path between two specific vertices.
   * Example: Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (modified for termination).
3. **All-Pairs Shortest Path**:
   * Find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.
   * Examples: Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, Johnson's Algorithm.

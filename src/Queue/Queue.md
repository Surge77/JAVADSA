# Queue :

A queue is a fundamental data structure that operates on the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, 
meaning that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. 
This behavior is analogous to a line of people waiting for service: the first person in line is the first to be served.

- Key Characteristics of Queues:

1. FIFO Order: Elements are processed in the order they were added.
2. Two Ends: A queue has two ends:
3. Front: Where elements are removed (dequeued).
4. Rear: Where elements are added (enqueued).
5. Dynamic Size: Unlike arrays, queues can grow and shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.

- Unlike other data structures like LL,stacks,trees and heaps , queue questions are not specifically asked in interviews
- Queue is more or less used as helping data structure while solving questions on tree graphs.
- In trees graphs all the knowledge of stack queue will be tested while solving problems

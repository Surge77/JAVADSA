# Quick sort

Quick sort involves the concept of randomization.
In order to maintain the efficiency of quick sort we implement the concept of randomization in order to achieve best efficiency.
If we don't implement randomization then quick sort can lead to extremely bad complexities.

Randomization : 

Randomization in algorithms refers to the use of random numbers or random choices in the logic of an algorithm to influence its behavior. 
This technique can help improve performance, simplify the design, or provide solutions to problems that are difficult to solve deterministically.


# Time complexity of Randomized Quick sort ->

- The time complexity analysis majorly depends on no of operations. -> T(n)
- Here the no of operations is going to be depended upon the random number generated
- Worst case - O(n^2)
- Average case - O(nlogn)

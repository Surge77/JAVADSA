# Insertion Sort => 

arr[] = {2,6,9,12,15,7}

> Situation : 

- You've an array which has all the elements up until the last 2nd index n-2th index in ascending order (This is just a situation it can also change)
- Only the last element is not present at it's correct place


- The crux is we need to insert the misplaced element in its right position

# Time Complexity : O(n^2) => Worst case

# Space complexity : O(1) 

# Is insertion sort in place => yes

# is insertion sort stable => yes
